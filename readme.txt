### Real Estate Listings Maps

Google Maps is integrated into each listing. When adding a listing, you simply need to start typing the address and Google will help you find the exact address and location. You can even move the map marker and place wherever you like.

### Real Estate Search

The search box is extremely smart. 

It uses a combination of Google Maps Geocoding, radius searching and traditional searching for keywords to help find relevant results. As well as this it also has a number of attributes to help narrow the results such as Type of property, min & max bedrooms, min & max price, Buy or Rent and more.

### Real Estate Listings Shortcodes

The shortcodes can be easily customized, with each shortcode having many options. 

* [wre_listings] - Used to display all the listings or filter listings by attributes like agent_id, listing_ids etc provided in the shortcode.
* [wre_search] - Used to display search box
* [wre_listing] - Used to display single listing on the front-end
* [wre_agent] - Used to display single agent details on the front-end
